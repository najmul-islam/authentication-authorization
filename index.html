                    </div>
                    Basic Authentication involves sending user credentials (username and password) with each request.
                    The credentials are
                    usually encoded in Base64 and included in the Authorization header of the HTTP request. This method
                    is simple but less
                    secure as it involves transmitting credentials with each request, which can be vulnerable if not
                    used over HTTPS.

                    </div>
                    Session-Based Authentication involves maintaining a session on the server side. After a user logs in
                    successfully, a
                    session is created, and a session ID is stored on the server. The session ID is then sent to the
                    client as a cookie. The
                    client sends this cookie with subsequent requests, allowing the server to identify and authenticate
                    the user. This
                    method keeps credentials secure but requires server-side session management.

                    </div>
                    Cookie-Based Authentication is a variant of session-based authentication where the server stores
                    session data in
                    cookies. After successful login, the server sends a cookie containing a session ID to the client.
                    The client includes
                    this cookie with each request, allowing the server to recognize and authenticate the user. This
                    method simplifies
                    session management but requires careful handling of cookies to ensure security.

                            Authentication</a></div>
                    Token-Based Authentication involves generating a token (e.g., JWT or opaque token) after a user logs
                    in. The token is
                    then sent to the client, which includes it in the Authorization header for subsequent requests. The
                    server validates the
                    token to authenticate the user. This method is stateless and can be used in distributed systems, but
                    it requires secure
                    token storage and handling.

                            (JSON Web Token) Authentication</a></div>
                    JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication is a type of token-based authentication where the token is a
                    JWT. A JWT contains
                    encoded information about the user and is signed to ensure its integrity. After successful login,
                    the server issues a
                    JWT to the client, which includes it in the Authorization header. The server verifies the JWT to
                    authenticate the user.
                    JWTs are stateless and can include user claims but require careful handling to prevent security
                    issues.

                            Authentication Services</a></div>
                    Third-Party Authentication Services involve using external providers (e.g., Google, Facebook,
                    GitHub) to authenticate
                    users. Users log in using their credentials from these providers, and the service returns an
                    authentication token or
                    identity information. The application can then use this information to identify and authenticate the
                    user. This method
                    leverages established providers for security and convenience but requires integration with the
                    providerâ€™s API.
